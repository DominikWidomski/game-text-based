# Text based adventure game

Bit of a sandbox to play around with some concepts and structures to facilitate the creation of a text based adventure game in a web browser.

## Objectives

What I wish to implement in the game:

- Characters and squad mechanics
- Inventory
- Rooms, possibly procedurarily generated
- Actions to be taken in rooms
- Combat mechanics based on statistics
- Quests
- Pre and post action effects with accompanying text feedback to player
